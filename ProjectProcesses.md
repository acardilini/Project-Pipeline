# Project Processes

## Working with Code
When working on a project that requires the development of code or programming, make sure to do this within a Virtual Environment. Virtual environments are a way of compartmentalising the computing environment that you are working from, and means that you can install software and packages that will not be included in your main computing environment. Virtual environments can be saved and shared with other people so that you can be sure that each person within a project is working within a computing environment that is exactly the same. This is important because software and computing environments can change very quickly due to constant updates. Such updates can effect your code and potentially the project that is being run. For instance, if you are working on a bioinformatics project that calls a program that relies on several software dependancies then you want to make sure these depencies stay the same. On your main computer you will be updating these dependancies over time which may influence your analysis. By creating a VE you can maintain an space that will not change and therefore break your analysis.
