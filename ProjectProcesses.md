# Project Processes

## What is a Project
When I talk about a project I mean a definable piece of work that is usually focused on a topic or goal. A project could be a large undertaking that will require several years to come to fruition and which contains many other sub-projects, or could be small and  self-contained and will only take a couple of weeks, or anything in between. A project is something that requires planning and work to pull off and which you have committed to doing. Projects may be of a personal nature, related to work or define research that you wish to conduct. 

## Before a Project Begins
You will have usually already done a lot of work before making the decision to commit to a project. You may have done some research to help you decide whether you will take on the project, or perhaps you have done extensive reading which has helped you formulate the project you are about to undertake. Remember to keep in mind what you already know as you embark on planning you project.

## Create a Work Space
Once you have decided to undertake a project create a space where you can store any and all information about it.

## Working with Code
When working on a project that requires the development of code or programming, make sure to do this within a Virtual Environment. Virtual environments are a way of compartmentalising the computing environment that you are working from, and means that you can install software and packages that will not be included in your main computing environment. Virtual environments can be saved and shared with other people so that you can be sure that each person within a project is working within a computing environment that is exactly the same. This is important because software and computing environments can change very quickly due to constant updates. Such updates can effect your code and potentially the project that is being run. For instance, if you are working on a bioinformatics project that calls a program that relies on several software dependancies then you want to make sure these depencies stay the same. On your main computer you will be updating these dependancies over time which may influence your analysis. By creating a VE you can maintain an space that will not change and therefore break your analysis.
